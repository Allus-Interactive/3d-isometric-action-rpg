<b>Brief Game Summary:</b> Project “Titan” is an ARPG with a semi-serious story mixed with some daft/comedic/sarcastic dialogue. The game is set in a fantasy realm during an era when brave Vikings travelled across the Sea from their homeland to find fame and fortune in foreign lands. As our young, brash hero, you must battle the Queen’s soldiers and wild monsters as you traverse the land; finding ancient weapons, helping various NPCs, venturing across the realm (using special “Wizard Magik” known as “fast-travel”), and seeking even bigger and badder enemies/monsters to slay, ending with the infamous ‘King of Monsters’.
