The game is set in a fantasy realm during an era when brave Vikings travelled across the Sea from their homeland to find fame and fortune in foreign lands. As our young, brash hero, you must venture across the realm; battling the Queen’s soldiers and wild monsters, finding ancient and powerful weapons, helping various NPCs, and of obviously seeking even bigger and badder enemies/monsters to defeat.
